<!-- intro-story-and-rules, 
 In a small Beverly Hills town where bowling was more than just a pastime, there was a billionaire with a passion for strikes and sparesâ€”Bruce Bayne, a man whose bank account was as hefty as his bowling ball. One fateful day, he stumbled upon three nerdsâ€”Clark, Gus, and Richieâ€”who were more accustomed to coding than throwing balls down lanes. These guys were the epitome of gutter balls, but they shared an unbreakable bond forged through their shared love for bowling, meeting every weekend until they were rudely kicked out by the indomitable Facebook MOM group, whose combined bowling skills were sharper than their online memes.
